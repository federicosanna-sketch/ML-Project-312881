## Section 1: Introduction

This project explores the design and implementation of a machine learning–based system aimed at addressing a specific real-world or analytical problem through data-driven methods. The primary objective of the project is to develop, evaluate, and analyze a model (or set of models) that can effectively learn patterns from data and produce meaningful insights.

Our work focuses on investigating how different design choices—such as feature representation, model architecture, and training strategies—impact overall system performance. By structuring the project as an end-to-end pipeline, we aim to provide a clear and reproducible workflow that spans data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result interpretation. Ultimately, this project serves both as a practical application of machine learning concepts and as an experimental framework for understanding the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach.
